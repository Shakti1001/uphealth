<b>STORES</b><br /><br />

The Public Works Department and certain other departments of Government, viz. Jails, Agriculture etc. obtain large amount of stores for consumption, manufacture or otherwise. The departmental officers entrusted with the care, use or consumption of these stores, are responsible for maintaining correct records and preparing correct returns in respect of the stores entrusted to them.<br /><br />
<b>Receipt of Stores</b><br /><br />
1 -All materials received should be examined, counted, measured or weighted, as the case may be, when delivery is taken, and they should be kept in-charge of a responsible Government servant who should be required to give a certificate that he actually received the materials and record them in any stock register prescribed for the purpose.<br />
2 -A department which is required to maintain regular accounts of stores under these rules shall not keep in hand any stores outside such accounts. If in any circumstances stores are received from another department or concern, not under the regular purchase or transfer system, e.g. as a gift or on the closing down of a concern, their value and quantity should be immediately adjusted in the accounts. The value of stores so received should be credited to the revenue of the State. No Stores shall be accepted by the receiving department unless they are likely to be of use of that department.<br /><br />
<b>Issue of Stores.</b><br /><br />
When materials are issued from stock for departmental use, manufacture or sale, etc. the Government servant in-charge of the stores should see that a requisition or indent in proper form has been made by a properly authorized person, examine it carefully with reference to any orders or rules for the issue of stores and sign it after making suitable alterations under his dated initials, in the description and quantity of materials, if he is unable to comply with the requisition in full. The requisition or indent should be returned at once to the requisitioning officer for signature. When materials are issued a written acknowledgment should be obtained from the person to whom they are ordered to be delivered or dispatched or from a duly authorized agent.<br /><br />
<b>Accounts</b><br /><br />
The accounts are of two kinds -<br /><br />
<b>Quantities accounts, and value accounts.</b><br /><br />
1 -All quantities received in or issued from stores should be entered in the stock account under the respective heads on the dates the transactions take place, and balances struck every month which should correspond to the quantities in stock at the close of each month.<br />
2 -The value account should show the money value of the materials received in and issued from stock. The value of all the materials obtained from different sources, either by cash payment or by book adjustment should therefore, be entered on the payment side. The receipt side should show the value of materials issued from time to time at rates which should be previously fixed by competent authorities after taking into account in addition to the original price, the cost of carriage and lossesfrom depreciation or wastage, cost of stores, godown and other similar charges, but should in no case exceed the market value. A general valuation should be made of the stock in hand at the close of each half-year at reasonably accurate price which should be reviewed from time to time and revised when necessary and then entered on the receipt side. The difference between the totals of the two columns will ordinarily show profit or loss in the operation of different classes of materials. This will enable the authorities to readjust the issue prices, where necessary.<br /><br />
<b>Stocktaking</b><br /><br />
The balance in stock should be examined periodically on such date as may be prescribed for each department to see whether the balance in hand represents the quantities as will as the value borne on the account books. Any discrepancy discovered in the verification should be fully explained and the book balance set right under orders of the competent authority, and surplus quantity being taken into the accounts as a receipt and a deficit quantity as in issue.<br />
